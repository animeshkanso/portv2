            I am a creator at heart. Fueled by curiosity and passion for turning ideas into reality. Since I love creating things, I am into entrepreneurship and want to start my own business.

            I have always been inspired by visionaries like Steve Jobs, who had an incredible ability to turn ideas into something truly special.
