So before reading this, I want to let you know that this will be a 5-part series and this is part 1.<br/><br/>

Why in parts? That is because I want to go deep, so that you will be able to set yourself apart and stand out. Because people notice trees before grass.<br/><br/>

I used to think that success was about achieving some kind of destination or a fancy title. But the more I learned, the more I observed all those successful people, the more I realized that success is actually about the journey. And that journey begins with a single question: What do you want to do?<br/><br/>

You have to figure this out, even before thinking of surpassing the crowd in front of you.<br/><br/>

Today in this letter, I will help you answer that question, and make you aware of your life's purpose. Over the next few weeks, we'll dive deeper into the strategies and mindset shifts you need to surpass 99% of people and achieve your goals.<br/><br/>

So reset your mind, and try to actively read as much as you can.<br/><br/>

### Part 1. Find Your Purpose<br/><br/>

> Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. - Steve Jobs <br/><br/>

You cannot achieve anything in your life unless you know the answer to this fundamental question. <br/><br/>

What exactly excites you? and what makes you want to wake up the next day and work towards it.<br/><br/>
To become better than most of the people you need to be fully self aware.<br/><br/>

Grab a notebook, sit down and write about the things that interests you, things that you can do for hours. For me it is design and code - something that I can do for hours and can make me money or even a business.<br/><br/>

Remember, when you're doing something you love, you'll naturally be better at it than others who are just going through the motions whether it's a job or a business. Your passion will shine through, and people will take notice. So, take your time, and really think about what gets you excited.<br/><br/>

I said all of that because after observing the best of the best, I have come to believe that this is the secret sauce that sets them apart from those who are merely mediocre. It makes them more driven and resilient.<br/><br/>

But Animesh, what if I don't have any interests or passion?<br/><br/>

I know that everyone may not have a clear path and that's okay because I was the same. You know, it took me 1 whole year to finally figure out what I really liked. Before that I used to switch between different things and then finally it happened. This proves that sometimes, our interests evolve - so you're not alone.<br/><br/>

You just have to try out different things, take risks and experiment. For me, it was about creating something from scratch, and that led me to design and code (tech) and writing about it of course. You might be surprised at what you discover about yourself when you take the leap and start exploring.<br/><br/>

And I know that pursuing these things will lead me towards a better future, whether it's a business or personal satisfaction. If you're tired of feeling stuck in the race and want to build a business or make a substantial income that gives you the lifestyle you desire, then it's important to choose a pursuit that has the potential to generate real income.<br/><br/>

> *Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma â€” which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary - Steve Jobs*<br/><br/>

Think about it - when you're doing something you love and you get paid for it, you can design your life on your own terms. That's ultimate freedom. ( more on this topic in future ).<br/><br/>

I have learned a really big lesson along my journey that I wanna share with you. Each and every one of us is unique, and that's what makes our path to success different.<br/><br/>

There's no one-size-fits-all formula for achieving success. If someone claims that they can make you successful, just because it worked for them, doesn't guarantee that you'll get the same results. Your success depends on your individual skills and interests.<br/><br/>

Trust me, I have been there too. I've tried things that worked for others, but didn't work for me. I realized that it wasn't because I wasn't working hard enough, but because I was trying to fit into someone else's mold.<br/><br/>

The key realization that I had, was that it all depends on whether I'm doing something I truly love or just following the crowd. It makes all the difference.<br/><br/>

For proof, think about this: two people can have the same education and background and do the same thing, but their outcomes can be vastly different. Why? Because one of them may not have been passionate about their work, while the other truly loved what they did.<br/><br/>

So, don't compare yourself to others. Instead, focus on your own strengths, pursuing your passions, and developing what makes you unique.<br/><br/>

Now here is the thing, if you have read this far, then congratulations. This wasn't a long letter but trust me, it proves that you want to change.<br/><br/>

But this isn't enough, you need to do the work. So try to find your thing and what makes you unique, and try to think on a deeper level to truly grasp everything. So go and do it now.<br/><br/>

See you in the next one.<br/><br/>

Animesh.
